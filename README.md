## Team Organic Matter
Van den Borne: making stastical insights available to the farmer in the field

Our team is going to

1. gain statistical insights from Jacob's different datasets. We'll focus on 2 of his 100+ parcels from 2015.
2. design an interface that gives the farmer information about a plot as he moves onto it. Guiding question is: what information can he get about the parcel from the sensordata, the managementdata and the historical data?
