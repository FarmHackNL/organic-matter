Van den Borne: making stastical insights about data available in the field

Our team is looking to

1. gain statistical insights from the different datasets Jacob has, we'll do this for 2 of the 100+ parcels he has, using the data from 2015
2. designing an interface for a farmer to use as he enters a particular parcel: what information can he get about the parcel from the sensordata, the managementdata and the historical data?
